Please Note: Some of the notebooks were part of the Image Segmentation Workshop conducted at IIIT Delhi. I use these notebooks for practice and learning purposes.

## PyTorch and Vision Basics

This notebook covers the basics of PyTorch and the torchvision library, providing a foundation for building and training neural networks.

## SimpleCNN on MNIST

A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the basics of CNN architecture and training.

## TensorBoard Visualization

A notebook demonstrating how to use TensorBoard for visualizing training metrics, model graphs, and more.

## U-Net

An implementation of the U-Net architecture, a popular model for image segmentation tasks.

## ResNet-18

An implementation of the ResNet-18 architecture, showcasing residual learning for image classification tasks.

## Mask-RCNN

A folder containing an implementation of the Mask-RCNN architecture for instance segmentation tasks.

## YOLO from Scratch

A folder containing a basic implementation of the YOLO object detection model from scratch.
